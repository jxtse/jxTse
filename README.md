# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning mathemetics & computer science
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on AIGC and any other interesting things

## WHO I AM?
My english name is Richard Tse and I'm an 20-year young adventurer based in Beijing. Whether I'm travelling through the trails or losing myself in a photography session, you'll likely find me seeking out experiences that take me out of my comfort zone.
When I need to refuel, you'll find me reading and writing. It helps me recharge so I can jump headfirst back into life. Creativity and learning are also big drivers for me. I'm always digging into humanities and technology and trying new technicals(btw. I am really into LLM and AI these days).

I also enjoy seeking out new cultures through travel. Past trips have taken me everywhere from Hong Kong to Singapore. There's nothing like immersing yourself in different places to gain fresh perspective and meet interesting people along the way. Exploration is in my blood.

## COOL THINGS THAT I DID
Participate in NUS School of Science Summer Workshop: The first time I go abroad alone. Study and live at a world-leading university really open my mind and horizons.
Persist in writing and operate my own personal WeChat public account: Keep recording, meaning emerges naturally.
Travel to almost all provinces in China: Always on the road.
Being the President of Student Chapter in my university. Greatly improved my social skills and organizational skills.
